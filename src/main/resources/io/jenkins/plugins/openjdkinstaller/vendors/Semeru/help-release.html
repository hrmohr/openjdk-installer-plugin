<div class="warning">
    <p>
        When selecting <i>Latest</i> the installer will check for latest available release on each use.
        This can result in unpredictable build results. Instead, consider preinstalling a JDK on
        agents, using images that already include a JDK, or downloading the desired
        JDK manually and configuring the <q>Extract *.zip/*.tar.gz</q> installer.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not guaranteed that binaries are available for all OS/CPU combinations.
        Check <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads/" target="_blank">download page</a> for availability.
